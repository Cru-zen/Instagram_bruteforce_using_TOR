## Description
Simple Bruteforce attack using TOR.

What is TOR?
Tor, which stands for "The Onion Router", is a network and browser that allows users to anonymously browse the internet and access the dark web. Tor's technology, known as onion routing, scrambles a user's online activity by redirecting their traffic through a series of nodes, or routers, run by volunteers. This process creates multiple layers of encryption that make it difficult to track a user's online activity and identity: 
* Entry nodes: Encrypt the traffic and connect the user to the Tor network 
* Middle nodes: Encrypt the traffic to ensure anonymity 
* Exit nodes: Remove the final layer of encryption and send the data to its destination

Note that the present script is not an exhaustive guide, rather it is intended to build some basic skills and get familiar with the concepts.
